# Geonature
requirement for runing app: 
Angular cli OR Docker, Docker Compose on host machine.

## Run app with angular cli 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PnX-SI/GeoNature.git
git checkout docker

cd frontend

npm install
ng serve
```
That's it! :tada: :sparkles: :sparkles:


## Run app with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PnX-SI/GeoNature.git
git checkout docker

```
That's it! :tada: :sparkles: :sparkles:
